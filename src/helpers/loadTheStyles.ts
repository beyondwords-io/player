// This file doesn't actually do anything. It serves as a marker whose import
// line can be replaced during the build process to load the aggregate styles.
//
// Note that you should always load this file with a dynamic import rather than
// a static once or it will not work, i.e. import("../helpers/loadTheStyles.ts")
//
// See ./bin/vendor_style for more infromation.
