## Player Settings

The table below contains a list of properties that can be configured in the
player.  Usually, you will only need to set the identifiers such as `projectId`
and `contentId` and the rest of the settings will come from the API. If the
identifiers are changed after the player has loaded then a new API request will
be made to fetch the content and settings for those identifiers.

If you wish, you can override these settings in the
[`<script>` tag](./getting-started.md) before the player has loaded, or by
using the [player SDK](./player-sdk.md) after the player has loaded. It is also
possible to load the player without making any API request by 'overriding' the
content and adverts properties with valid data structures as specified in the
table below. This is useful for player demo sites, for example.

### Properties

| Name                | Type                  | Explanation |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| playerApiUrl        | string                | The URL of the API that the player should fetch its data from. This is only really useful if you're a BeyondWords developer and want to use the internal staging environment to test something.<br/><br/>Default value: https://api.beyondwords.io/v1/projects/{id}/player
| projectId           | number                | The numeric ID of your project. This can be retrieved from the BeyondWords dashboard by visiting a project and copying the numeric ID from within the URL.<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| contentId           | string or number      | The ID of content to load in the player. This can be retrieved from the BeyondWords dashboard by clicking on the embed button next to a piece of a content and copying it from within the code snippet. Normally this will be a string UUID, but legacy numeric IDs are also supported.<br/><br/><a id="note"></a>**Note:** The player loads content from a projectId and one or more of the following identifiers:<br/>{ contentId, playlistId, sourceId, sourceUrl, playlist }. If multiple identifiers are provided, the player will load all of the published content into a playlist, which might include other playlists. The order that content is loaded into the player will match the order of identifiers in this table. If you want to use a different order set the playlist property to an array of identifiers.<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| playlistId          | number                | The ID of a 'manual' or 'automatic' playlist to load in the player. This can be retrieved from the BeyondWords dashboard and appears as part of the URL. (see [note](#note) above regarding identifiers)<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| sourceId            | string                | The externally provided ID to load into the player. This is optional and may have been provided by you if you are using the BeyondWords API to create content. (see [note](#note) above regarding identifiers)<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| sourceUrl           | string                | The source URL to load into the player. This is optional and may be set by the WordPress plugin. This is the URL of where the content can be found on the web. This method of identifying content is discouraged in case the article moves to a different URL. (see [note](#note) above regarding identifiers)<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| playlist            | array of objects      | An array of identifiers to load into the player. The four identifiers above are supported. The order that content is loaded into the player will match the order of the array:<br/><br/>[<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{ contentId: "67f86dca-02e5-466d-99bf-0d1103f6c6e9" },<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{ contentId: "cc85c59c-7c68-4e5d-a225-eeecb40617e6" },<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{ sourceId: "some-external-id-set-by-you" },<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{ sourceUrl: "https://example.com/my-article" },<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{ playlistId: 12345 },<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{ playlistId: 67890 },<br/>]<br/><br/>If other top-level identifiers are set on the player such as contentId, these identifiers will be prepended to the playlist array and appear at the top. (see [note](#note) above regarding identifiers)<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| showUserInterface   | boolean               | Whether to show the user-interface. This can be set to false if you want to build your own user-interface on top of the core player functionality. See [Building your own UI](./building-your-own-ui.md) for more information.<br/><br/>Default value: true
| playerStyle         | string                | The style of player to display. There are five supported styles:<br/><br>- **small**: the smallest player that has the bare minimum of buttons<br/>- **standard**: the default player style that offers a good mix of functionality<br/>- **large**: a larger player that shows the playerTitle and an image<br/>- **screen**: a full screen player designed to be linked to from social media<br/>- **video**: a player that supports video adverts and scrolling text content<br/><br/>Default value: standard
| callToAction        | string                | The text to show on the player when it is stopped. If the text is set to 'Listen to this article' it will be translated according to the language property, assuming it is supported by the player.<br/><br/>Default value: Listen to this article
| skipButtonStyle     | string                | The style of the skip buttons. There are four supported styles:<br/><br>- **auto**: skip by 'tracks' for a playlist and 'segments' for a single item<br/>- **segments**: skip backwards and forwards by one paragraph<br/>- **seconds**: seek backwards and forwards by 10 seconds<br/>- **tracks:** skip backwards and forwards by one playlist track<br/><br/>By default, the 'seconds' style skips 10 seconds in both directions but you can control this with 'seconds-15' or 'seconds-15-30' to set a different number of seconds for backwards and forwards.<br/><br/>Default value: auto
| playlistStyle       | string                | Whether to show the playlist. There are three supported styles:<br/><br/>- **auto**: show the playlist when there is more than one content item<br/>- **show**: show the playlist by default (can still by toggled by the user)<br/>- **hide**: hide the playlist by default (can still be toggled by the user)<br/><br/>By default, the 'auto' and 'show' styles display 5 items on desktop and 4 on mobile before a scrollbar appears but you can set a different number.<br/><br/>For example, 'auto-3' will show 3 items and 'show-10-8' will show a different number on desktop and mobile. This can be set to a very large number, e.g. 'show-99999' to never show a scrollbar.<br/><br/>Default value: auto-5-4
| playerTitle         | string                | The title to show at the top of the large, screen and video players. Normally this is automatically set to the name of your project but can be specified in the BeyondWords dashboard.<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| content             | array of objects      | The array of content to play in the player. Normally this is automatically set based on the identifiers but it can be overridden if you wish to set the content manually without making API requests. A playlist will be shown in the player if the the array contains multiple items.<br/><br/><a id="note2"></a>**Note:** Each content item can contain several media files. The player will attempt to load them in order until a file format that it is able to play is found. If the playerStyle is 'video' it will attempt to load video media first, then fall back to audio. Otherwise, audio will be loaded first.<br/><br/>[<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id: "27b760cb-0838-4354-bf86-ac514c2ad0ca",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title: "Content Title",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpeg",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sourceUrl: "https://example.com/my-article",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adsEnabled: true,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration: 123.45,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;media: [{ id: 123, url: "https://example.com/audio.mp3", contentType: "audio/mpeg" }],<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segments: [{ marker: "paragraph-1", startTime: 0.05, duration: 9.95 }],<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br/>]<br/><br/>All fields are optional and the player will work with what it is given, rather than raise an error.<br/><br/>- id will be included in events sent to analyticsCustomUrl and Google Analytics<br/>- title will be shown for the content item in the player<br/>- imageUrl will be shown in the large, screen and video players<br/>- sourceUrl will be used as the href of a link in the screen player<br/>- adsEnabled will determine whether adverts play before/during/after this content item<br/>- duration is only used for display in the playlist and is normally fetched from the media<br/>- media is an array of audio and video sources for the content item (see above)<br/>- segments is an array of timestamps used for skipping between paragraphs<br/><br/>Default value: []
| contentIndex        | number                | The index of the active content item in the player. This can be set to change the track in a playlist.<br/><br/>Default value: 0
| adverts             | array of objects      | An array of adverts to play in the player. Normally ads are automatically set from your project but can be overridden if you wish to set the adverts manually. There are two types of advert:<br/><br/>- **custom**: An advert that specifies its own media sources and clickThroughUrl<br/>- **vast**: An advert that is fetched from the vastUrl, e.g. from Google Ads<br/><br/>In the case of a 'custom' advert, the vastUrl field will be ignored. In the case of a 'vast' advert, the clickThroughUrl and media fields will be ignored. There are three different placements:<br/><br/>- **pre-roll**: The advert plays before the content or between playlist items<br/>- **mid-roll**: The advert plays mid-way through a content item or between playlist items<br/>- **post-roll**: The advert plays after the content or between playlist items<br/><br/>[<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id: 123,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type: "custom",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placement: "pre-roll",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clickThroughUrl: "https://example.com/buy-my-product",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;textColor: "#00f",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 255, 200, 0.8)",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iconColor: "red",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;media: [{ id: 555, url: "https://example.com/advert.mp3", contentType: "audio/mpeg" }],<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id: 456,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type: "vast",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placement: "mid-roll",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vastUrl: "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/123456789/your/advert"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;textColor: "#00f",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 255, 200, 0.8)",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iconColor: "red",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;},<br/>]<br/><br/>See the [note](#note2) above about media sources which works in the same way for advert media. While an advert is playing it can 'take over' the user interface to show an image and different color theme or it will fall back to the default player colors for those that are not specified in the advert.
| advertIndex         | number                | The index of the active advert in the player. This can be set to play an advert, but it is recommended not to do this manually because the rules around the placement will not apply.<br/><br/>Default value: -1
| duration            | number                | The duration of the active content item in the player. The duration is fetched from the loaded media, rather than the duration field in the content item which is only used for the playlist display. This property is intended to be read-only and should not be set manually.<br/><br/>Default value: 0
| currentTime         | number                | The current playback time of the media. This can be set to seek to a new position.<br/><br/>Default value: 0
| playbackState       | string                | The current playback state of the media. The can be set to start or stop playback, provided the programmatic call is on behalf of a user action such as clicking a button. There are three states:<br/><br/>- **stopped**: playback has not yet started or it has finished<br/>- **playing**: the media for the content item is playing<br/>- **paused**: the media for the content item is paused<br/><br/>Default value: stopped
| playbackRate        | number                | The current playback rate of the media. This can be set to speed up or slow down playback. The playbackRate will persist across tracks but temporarily resets to 1 during adverts.<br/><br/>Default value: 1
| widgetStyle         | string                | The style of widget to display at the bottom of the page once the user scrolls past the inline player. All five styles are supported (see playerStyle). Can be set to "none" to hide the widget.<br/><br/>Default value: standard
| widgetPosition      | string                | The horizontal position of the widget when it is showing. There are four supported options:<br/><br/>- **auto**: show the widget in the center for the standard player, otherwise right<br/>- **left**: show the widget on the bottom-left corner of the screen<br/>- **center**: show the widget at the bottom of the screen in the middle<br/>- **right**: show the widget in the bottom-right corner of the screen<br/><br/>Default value: auto
| widgetWidth         | string                | The width of the widget. Can be set to any CSS unit, including 500px, 50rem, 50% and fit-content. This property can be set to 0 to make the player use its smallest possible width.<br/><br/>By default, the small playerStyle expands and collapses. You can force it to always be collapsed by setting this property to 0, or to always be expanded by setting this property to initial.<br/><br/>Default value: auto
| textColor           | string                | The text color. Can be set to any CSS color, including red, #f00, #ff0000 and rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8). This color can be overridden when an advert is playing by specifying it in the advert object.<br/><br/>Default value: #111
| backgroundColor     | string                | The background color. Can be set to any CSS color, including red, #f00 and rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8). This property can also be set to a linear gradient: linear-gradient(to right, #fcf, #fcc). This color can be overridden when an advert is playing by specifying it in the advert object.<br/><br/>Default value: #F5F5F5
| iconColor           | string                | The icon color. Can be set to any CSS color, including red, #f00, #ff000 and rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8). This color can be overridden when an advert is playing by setting it in the advert object.<br/><br/>Default value: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)
| advertConsent       | string                | The level of consent provided by the user of your website for whether personalized ads are allowed. This only applies to adverts of type 'vast' and maps onto the URL parameters documented [here](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/consent). You are responsible for requesting consent from your users. There are three supported levels:<br/><br/>- **personalized**: adds the npa=0 parameter to vastUrl so that personalized ads will play<br/>- **non-personalized**: adds the npa=1 parameter to vastUrl which switches off personalized ads<br/>- **under-the-age-of-consent**: adds the tfua=1 parameter which disables many forms of tracking<br/><br/>The player copies the approach taken by Google which is to enable personalized ads by default and place the burden on the integrator to ensure they have requested consent from their users.<br/><br/>Default value: personalized
| analyticsConsent    | string                | The level of consent provided by the user of your website for whether usage analytics are allowed to be sent by the player to the BeyondWords dashboard and to the analyticsCustomUrl if it is set. You are responsible for requesting consent from your users. There are three supported levels:<br/><br/>- **allowed**: analytics will be sent to BeyondWords and analyticsCustomUrl<br/>- **without-uuids**: analytics will be sent but without session UUIDs<br/>- **none**: analytics will not be sent to BeyondWords or analyticsCustomUrl<br/><br/>The player allows analytics by default because they do not contain any personally identifiable information and only contain random UUIDs to identify the same user across sessions. This UUID is persisted in local storage in the browser under the 'beyondwords' key.<br/><br/>Default value: allowed
| analyticsCustomUrl  | string                | A custom URL that analytics events should be sent to, in addition to BeyondWords. These events are exactly the same as those sent to BeyondWords. See [Custom Analytics](./custom-analytics.md) for more information.<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| analyticsTag        | string                | The Google Measurement ID to use when sending events to Google Analytics. When analyticsTag is set, events will always be sent to Google Analytics, regardless of analyticsConsent.<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
| writeToken          | string                | The BeyondWords write token for your project. This feature is used by our WordPress plugin during the editing workflow to listen for the 'processed' event and reload the player content is ready.<br/><br/>We strongly recommend you think carefully when using this feature to ensure that writeToken is not leaked to the public since it can be used to modify content within your project. Also, this feature is **unsupported** and we may replace it with a different mechanism in the future.<br/><br/>Default value: undefined
