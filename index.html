    <h1>BeyondWords Player</h1>

    <script async defer type="module" src="src/index.ts" onload='new BeyondWords.Player({
      target: this,
      playerTitle: "BeyondWords Player",
      playlist: [{ title: "This is an example page that contains the BeyondWords Player", duration: 100 }],

    })'>
    </script>

    <p>
      This is an example page that contains the BeyondWords Player. It is used
      during the development of the player to test the effects of code changes
      in this repository.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use this page to test different styles of player by running the
      <span class="code">./bin/server</span> script on your computer and then
      editing the <span class="code">index.html</span> file in the root of this
      repository. The player is intialized in the script tag at the top of this
      page and takes various options.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, you could pass the <span class="code">interfaceStyle: "small"</span>
      option to change the style of player. You can also make changes in a
      JavaScript console, without having to run the project locally, e.g.
      <span class="code">BeyondWords.Player.instances()[0].interfaceStyle = "small"</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      The automated tests in this project also use this page. They take
      screenshots of the player's user interface and compare them against
      previous images for regressions.
