      This is a demo page for the
      <a href="https://beyondwords.io/" target="_blank">BeyondWords</a> Player.
      As you listen to the audio, the player will automatically update to
      demonstrate its key features. Additionally, on desktop, you can use the
      control panel on the right to customize the player and inspect its
      properties.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="7b4afe4c-b3be-42c7-a7d4-6a657fa5acd4">
      This page is intended to help integrators understand the capabilities of
      the player and to make it easier to add the player to your website. For
      more detailed documentation, please refer to the
      <a href="https://github.com/beyondwords-io/player" target="_blank">player repository</a>

      Player Styles
    </h2>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="a160fb43-0fc9-4032-9ffc-51c863d2739e">
      The player supports five different styles: 'small', 'standard', 'large', 'screen'
      and 'video'.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="e2af6c9e-241f-45d9-a7dc-2e70e50d4187">
      The <strong>small</strong> player style, currently visible, is our most
      compact style and takes up minimal space on your page. When used in the
      widget at the bottom of the page, it automatically expands and collapses
      when interacting with it, although you can customize this behavior.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="f33c7e8e-78b2-4a0c-989b-c300aff144fd">
      The <strong>standard</strong> player style is the default and it's what we recommend for
      most people. It provides a balance of functionality while taking up a
      small-ish amount of space on the page. On mobile, a right-to-left layout
      is used since most users are right-handed.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="c3419771-64e8-47d5-8114-efe934a40c73">
      The <strong>large</strong> player style turns the player into more of a feature on your
      webpage. It shows an image and supports an additional title that can vary
      depending on the content or advert that is playing. We recommend this
      style for playlists of multiple content items.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="dd0fe86a-ec06-4490-b756-988ed881a6c8">
      The <strong>screen</strong> player style is intended to be used when the player takes up
      the full screen, i.e. to create a dedicated landing page for your content.
      We use this style at BeyondWords to provide a URL that allows content to
      be shared on social media, such as
      <a href="https://audio.beyondwords.io/playlist/86791" target="_blank">this one</a>.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="0dbdb40f-2100-4273-bab6-594a225f6def">
      The <strong>video</strong> player style is our latest addition that
      supports video playback. You will soon be able to generate videos of your
      content being read out word-by-word to make the experience more engaging
      for your users. We haven't launched this quite yet, but you can see a demo
      of this feature on
      <a href="https://beyondwords-io.github.io/player-demo" target="_blank">this page</a>
      by setting the 'Player style' dropdown to 'video'.
    </p>

    <h2 data-beyondwords-marker="5e36c61d-70f7-40b0-8628-a4209fefb6df">
      Player Colors
    </h2>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="59185256-0aa9-4776-b928-0d740e7fe2ca">
      The player supports a range of color settings to make it fit with your
      brand. Colors can be set to any CSS value, such as 'red', '#F00' and
      'rgb(255, 0, 0)'.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="2483a58b-01b6-4d6f-adb6-bc5b567b649e">
      The <strong>backgroundColor</strong> setting affects the background of the
      player in all user interfaces, including the widget that appears at the
      bottom of the screen. Additionally, a linear-gradient can be set to add
      visual interest. Horizontal and vertical gradients are supported.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="bafe15f4-538e-4869-86c4-41120af8155e">
      The <strong>textColor</strong> setting is self-explanatory and sets the
      text color throughout the player. Similarly, the <strong>iconColor</strong>
      property allows the buttons and progress bar color to change.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="005616f2-b346-49bb-8534-05e4d6e749f3">
      The <strong>highlightColor</strong> setting changes the color of
      the text highlights on the page as the article is being read out. Again,
      this setting supports linear-gradients.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="9a57b07b-c669-4ef5-a8aa-214ef204acdd">
      When combined, these color settings create a distinctive look for the
      player that can fit your brand. Here is an example of a player that might
      fit a news brand and here is an example of a player that might fit an
      eco-friendly brand.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="bc0a38f4-eb68-4452-90b3-112299339f87">
      Finally, the player allows adverts to "take over" the look of the player.
      For example, a Domino's Pizza advert could set the colors to match its
      brand.
    </p>

    <h2 data-beyondwords-marker="c8633ed6-6ecb-4847-a477-bfcfbb0f374d">
      Segment Playback
    </h2>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="cb48d272-6498-4135-a572-a3ec259632f5">
      As you have probably noticed by now, one of the key features of the
      BeyondWords player is the ability to playback from segments. This feature
      allows users to click on a paragraph within your article and the audio
      will immediately skip to that location.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="5e941dd2-3dbd-43ac-9bc3-989953846ef8">
      The added text highlights help users follow along with the content as it
      is being read out and the hover effect emphasizes that paragraphs can
      be clicked on. These behaviors can be configured independently, e.g. you
      can choose not to highlight the current segment.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="e56fd498-c55d-4ccb-b55b-966d93e7381d">
      The segment widget that appears next to paragraphs can be switched on or
      off or used instead of the ability to click on paragraphs. The segment
      widget's progress bar changes as you hover over paragraphs within the
      article to show their start time within the audio.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="17c3efab-2eb4-4518-bacf-71288822ee70">
      The segment widget can be positioned in one of twelve positions next to
      the paragraph. For convenience, these are named after hours on a clock,
      for example 12-oclock appears at the top, 3-oclock on the right, 6-oclock
      at the bottom and 9-oclock on the left.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="0c1c7361-30cc-4326-aec8-84c7560083e2">
      To support segment playback on your website, you will need to add some
      markers into the HTML of your page, although, if you are using our
      <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/speechkit/" target="_blank">WordPress plugin</a>,
      they will be added automatically. Please refer to our
      <a href="https://github.com/beyondwords-io/player/blob/main/doc/segments-playback.md" target="_blank">dedicated guide</a>
      for more information.
    </p>

    <h2 data-beyondwords-marker="5f9bef7d-c9fa-4760-b8a2-77c325ad3d06">
      Media Sessions
    </h2>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="95f5752b-27c2-49b1-93ce-f78382505e35">
      The player supports 'Media Sessions', which allows users to interact with
      the player on their phone's lock screen, or other Media Session enabled
      devices. For example, users can use their wireless headphones to
      play/pause and skip forwards and backwards.
