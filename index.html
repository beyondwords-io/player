      This is an example page that contains the
      <a href="https://beyondwords.io/" target="_blank">BeyondWords</a> Player.
      It is used during the development of the player to test the effects of
      code changes in this repository.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="37ac781a-04f2-4377-b01f-1dba1c45363a">
      You can use this page to test different styles of player by running the
      <span class="code">./bin/server</span> script on your computer and then
      editing the <span class="code">index.html</span> file in the root of this
      repository. The player is intialized in the script tag at the top of this
      page and takes various options.
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="492dcc81-d1e6-421b-a7d8-e754eb65bd94">
      For example, you could pass the <span class="code">playerStyle: "small"</span>
      option to change the style of player. You can also make changes in a
      JavaScript console, without having to run the project locally, e.g.
      <span class="code">BeyondWords.Player.instances()[0].playerStyle = "small"</span>
    </p>

    <p data-beyondwords-marker="28e3f9ba-1d47-426e-b0a5-181607dd81dd">
      The automated tests in this project also use this page. They take
      screenshots of the player's user interface and compare them against
      previous images for regressions.
