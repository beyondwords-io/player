      A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group highlights that New Zealand's gas supply could potentially halve again in the next five years, emphasizing the need for immediate intervention to secure remaining resources. The report notes that New Zealand's gas supply has already decreased by 50% since 2015, with prices more than doubling during that time, contributing to last year's significant spike in power prices. Factors such as the decline of aging offshore fields and the potential exit of major gas users are expected to continue pressuring both gas and electricity affordability and security.
